The main project idea is creating a modern-day vehicle with the following features

⦁ Lane Departure Warning: Whenever the vehicle moves out of its lane the driver will be informed.                                             In the vehicle  created, two line tracking sensors to detect whenever the vehicle leaves its lane not only that but also a buzzer and a     led are used to warn the driver when that happens.

⦁ Warning Indicators and Power Mirrors: The driver should be informed when it's raining or the fuel level is low through the dashboard LCD,   and also the driver should be warned audibly if the seat belt is not worn. The driver is also able to control the direction of the         mirrors.    
  The approach in creating this feature was to use a rain sensor to detect when it's raining, a water level sensor to know the fuel           spercentage in the tank, a button to simulate the seat belt and both a buzzer and an LCD to warn the driver.
  
⦁ Keyless Entry: The driver should be able to lock and unlock the vehicle without using a physical key and also should be able to start the   car with a "Start Engine" button.                                                   
    The idea here was to use an "RFID" Reader to detect when the key is near and automatically unlock the car and a simple switch for           starting and stopping the engine.
